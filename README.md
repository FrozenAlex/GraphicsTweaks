# GraphicsTweaks

Use `qpm-rust s build` to build
Same goes for `qpm-rust s copy` and `qpm-rust s qmod`

## Hot Reloading

To enable hot reloading, you need to uncomment `add_compile_options(-DHotReload)` in `CMakeLists.txt` and build again.

To automatically copy the templates to quest you need to run `npm install` in the project folder and then `npm run watch` to start the watcher, it will automatically copy the bsml files to the quest when they change and the mod will reload them every 0.5s.
